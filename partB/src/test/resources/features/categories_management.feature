@categories
Feature: Category Management API Testing
  As a user of the REST API Category Manager
  I want to be able to create, read, update, and delete categories
  So that I can classify and organize my todos and projects effectively

  Background:
    Given the Category API is reachable
    And my list of categories is cleared to start fresh

  @category_create
  Scenario Outline: Create a new category
    As a user, I want to create a new category with a title and optional description.
    # POST /categories
    When I send a request to create a category with these details:
      | title      | description       |
      | <title>    | <description>     |
    Then the category creation status should be <status_code>
    And the saved category should show field "title" with value "<expected_title>"
    And the saved category should show field "description" with value "<expected_description>"
    And the system should tell me if there was an error: "<expected_error_message>"
